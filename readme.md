# DevTribe 2.0

DevTribe 2.0 is a GitHub project that serves as a hub for all the projects we will build as a community.

## Motivation

This project was created to bring together intuitively motivated programmers who are passionate about learning, sharing knowledge, and building innovative projects. Our goal is to foster a collaborative environment where developers of all skill levels can contribute, grow, and create impactful software together.
